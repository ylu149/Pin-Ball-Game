# Pinball-Esque Game

## Introduction
Welcome to my work-in-progress pinball game, a dynamic and interactive game created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game combines classic pinball elements with modern web technologies to deliver an engaging and fun experience right in your web browser.

## Features
- **Dynamic Objects**: Includes various game objects like balls, paddles, bricks, and more.
- **Custom Physics**: Experience badly designed ball movements and collisions.
- **Interactive Paddles**: Control paddles to keep the ball in play.

## Installation
To play the game, simply clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ylu149/Pin-Ball-Game.git
unzip Pin-Ball-Game-main.zip
cd Pin-Ball-Game-main
```

## How to Play
- **Control the Paddles**: Use the arrow keys to control the paddles.
- **Keep the Ball in Play**: The main objective is to keep the ball moving and in play for as long as possible.
- **Score Points**: Get points every time a ball bounces off objects that aren't a paddle. 

## Game Objects
- **Ball**: A core element of the game, this is a bouncing ball that players must keep in motion.
- **Paddle**: These are player-controlled elements used to hit the ball and keep it in play.
- **Brick**: These are obstacles placed in the game area that can be broken by the ball to score points.
- **Pentagon**: Unique game objects with special interactions (elaborate on this if your game includes such features).
